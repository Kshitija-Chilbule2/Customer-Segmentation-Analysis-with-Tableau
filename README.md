## Background
SpicyFood, a fictional FoodTech company, aims to strengthen its customer engagement and retention strategies by gaining a deeper understanding of customer behavior. With a growing user base and increasing competition, identifying high-value customers and tailoring marketing efforts accordingly has become a key business priority.

To support this goal, a Customer Segmentation Dashboard was developed using Tableau, applying RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis to derive actionable insights from customer purchase data.

Let‚Äôs first take a look at what Recency, Frequency, and Monetary are:
- **(Recency) R**‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäHow recent was the last purchase of a customer?
- **(Frequency) F**‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäHow often does a customer make a transaction?
- **(Monetary) M**‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäHow much money does a customer spend on a purchase?

## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to segment customers based on their purchasing patterns using RFM analysis, enabling SpicyFood to:
- Identify and retain valuable customers
- Personalize marketing campaigns
- Reduce customer churn
- Optimize marketing spend
- Improve overall customer lifetime value (CLV)

This segmentation helps categorize customers into groups, such as Champions, Loyal Customers, At-Risk, and others, providing clear direction for strategic business decisions.

## Data Collection
The dataset includes essential details like Customer ID, Purchase Frequency, Bill Amount, Recency, and other relevant attributes.

The dataset used for this analysis includes the following fields:

- **Customer ID:** Unique identifier for each customer.
- **Purchase Frequency:** The number of purchases a customer makes.
- **Bill Amount:** Total monetary value spent by the customer.
- **Recent Purchase Date:** The customer‚Äôs latest purchase date.
- **Rank_Recency:** Ranking based on the recency of purchases.
- **Rank_Frequency:** Ranking based on purchase frequency.
- **Rank_Spending:** Ranking based on the total spending amount.
- **Average of Rank:** Average rank across recency, frequency, and spending.
- **Overall Rank:** Combined rank for RFM segmentation.
- **Customer Tiers:** Segmented customer groups based on RFM scores.
- **Gender:** Gender of the customer.
- **Age:** Age of the customer.

## Live Tableau Dashboard
The final Tableau dashboard provides an interactive and visually compelling representation of key insights, enabling SpicyFood management to:
- Identify and target high-value customers.
- Re-engage at-risk customers to minimize churn.
- Strengthen retention strategies for long-term customer loyalty.
- Optimize marketing campaigns for better engagement and ROI.
